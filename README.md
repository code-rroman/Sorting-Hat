# Sorting-Hat
The Sorting Hat is a magical talking hat at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The hat decides which of the four "Houses" each first-year student goes to:
🦁 Gryffindor
🦅 Ravenclaw
🦡 Hufflepuff
🐍 Slytherin

🧙‍♂️ The Sorting Hat Quiz
A simple, interactive Python program that sorts users into one of the four Hogwarts houses based on their answers to a short quiz — inspired by the magical world of Harry Potter!

🧪 How It Works
The quiz asks the user three multiple-choice questions. Based on their responses, each Hogwarts house — Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin — receives a certain number of points.

At the end, the house with the highest score is announced as the user's match!

✅ Questions & Scoring
Do you like Dawn or Dusk?

Dawn → +1 to Gryffindor & Ravenclaw

Dusk → +1 to Hufflepuff & Slytherin

How do you want to be remembered?

The Good → +2 to Hufflepuff

The Great → +2 to Slytherin

The Wise → +2 to Ravenclaw

The Bold → +2 to Gryffindor

Which instrument most pleases your ear?

Violin → +4 to Slytherin

Trumpet → +4 to Hufflepuff

Piano → +4 to Ravenclaw

Drum → +4 to Gryffindor

🏆 Output
The program displays the final scores for each house and declares the winning house based on the highest score.

Example output:

Gryffindor: 5  
Ravenclaw: 3  
Hufflepuff: 1  
Slytherin: 2  

Gryffindor Wins!

⚠️ Notes
The quiz expects valid input values (e.g., 1–2 or 1–4 depending on the question).

Invalid inputs will result in a "Wrong input." message but will not crash the program.

✨ Future Ideas
Add more questions for better sorting accuracy.

Allow ties or provide personality breakdowns.
